## Conservation Smart Contract UI

## Overview
The Conservation Smart Contract UI allows users to interact with a decentralized platform designed for funding and tracking environmental conservation projects. Built on blockchain technology, this UI provides transparency and security for project creators, donors, and voters, enabling them to manage projects, make donations, vote on project outcomes, and record environmental impacts.

## Features
1. Project Management: Create and manage conservation projects, including adding milestones and recording impact metrics.
2. Donor Management: Allow users to make donations and track their contributions to various projects.
3. Voting Mechanism: Stake tokens and vote on project proposals or milestones.
4. Milestone Tracking: Set and track milestones for each project, ensuring accountability.
5. Environmental Impact Data: Record and retrieve data related to the environmental impact of funded projects.

## Architecture
The UI communicates with the Conservation Smart Contract through web3.js (or a similar library), enabling interactions with the blockchain. The following components are included in the UI:

1. Connect Wallet: A component for users to connect their blockchain wallet.
2. Project Dashboard: Displays all active projects, their funding status, and details.
3. Project Creation Form: A form for creating new projects.
4. Milestone Management: Interface for adding and completing project milestones.
5. Voting Interface: Allows users to stake tokens and cast votes on projects.

## Error Handling
The UI includes basic error handling to inform users of common issues, such as:

Insufficient funds for donations.
Voting on closed projects.
Duplicate project submissions.
